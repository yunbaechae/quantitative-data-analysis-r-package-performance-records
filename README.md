# Quantitative Data Analysis and R Package Development for Performance Records

STAT1378 Coding and Communication in Statistics Assignment 2 (2021)

This assignment conducted quantitative analysis of Mario Kart 64 world records data, including trend modelling and empirical validation. Developed a custom R package for reproducible computations and analysis.

## Key Tasks
- Processed records data for statistical exploration  
- Modelled performance trends and duration patterns  
- Built R package for data manipulation and validation  

## Skills Demonstrated
- R programming and package development  
- Quantitative data processing and trend analysis  
- Reproducible research and statistical validation  
- Empirical modelling techniques
